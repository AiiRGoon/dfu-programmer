# Tests

These tests should be able to run on any system, given that hardware requirements are met.
Our local unit test are run on an [AVR Test HAT](https://github.com/cinderblock/avr-test-hat).

### Minimum "Full" Test System Setup

- ATmega8u2 connected to the USB port of the test system.
- AVRDUDE setup to program the ATmega8u2
  - A program on the path called `avrdude.sh` that adds the correct `-c`, `-B`, `-P`, and `-p` options to the `avrdude` command. Running without arguments should successfully communicate and identify the ATmega8u2.
- Permissions to access usb devices as the current user.

## Goals

1. âœ… Functionality testing
2. ðŸ’¯% code coverage (This will take more hardware!)

## Tests

We're using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) to run the tests with a thin wrapper around the executable.

To run these tests on your system, you just need a recent-ish version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Then run:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

### Software Environment

Available environment variables:

 - `$DFU` - The path to the recently built `dfu-programmer` executable.
 - `$TARGET` - The correct "target" argument that dfu-programmer should use for the attached device.
 - `$AVRDUDE` - A path to avrdude to needed flags. Just add "-U flash:r:-:h" to read the flash memory as hex bytes
